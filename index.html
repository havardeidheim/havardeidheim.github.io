    Here begins the epitome on the knightly art of combat that was composed and
    created by Johannes Liechtenauer, who was a great master in the art, God
    have mercy on him; first with the long sword, then with the lance and sword
    on horseback, and then with the short sword in armoured combat. Because the
    art belongs to princes and lords, knights and squires, and they should know
    and learn this art, he has written of this art in hidden and secret words,
    so that not everyone will grasp and understand it, as you will find
    described below. And he has done this on account of frivolous fight masters
    who mistake the art as trivial, so that such masters will not make his art
    common or open with people who do not hold the art in respect as is its due.
